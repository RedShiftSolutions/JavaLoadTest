Simple application used for demonstration.  Has a list of primes less than 200, and take a list of arguments.  If any of those arguments is a prime less than 200, fails with system exit code 1.  If an argument cannot be parsed as a number, fails with exit code 2.  Otherwise, exits with exit code 0.

See the Jenkinsfile for exmaple of use.
